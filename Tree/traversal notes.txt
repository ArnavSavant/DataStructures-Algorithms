Tree traversal algorithms like Pre-order, Post-order, and In-order traversals are fundamental techniques used in computer science, particularly in the fields of data structures and algorithms. These traversal methods are primarily used with binary trees but can be adapted for other types of trees as well. Each traversal order serves different purposes:

1. **Pre-Order Traversal (Root, Left, Right):**
   - **Creation of Copy of the Tree:** Pre-order traversal is used when you want to create a replica of the tree. Since it visits nodes starting from the root, it helps in preserving the structure and relationships of the original tree in the copy.
   - **Expression Trees:** In expression trees, pre-order traversal gives a prefix expression (Polish notation). It's useful in applications such as compilers and calculators where expressions need to be parsed and evaluated.
   - **Tree Flattening or Serialization:** Pre-order traversal is helpful in flattening a tree structure into a linear one, like an array or a string, for the purposes of storage or transmission.

2. **Post-Order Traversal (Left, Right, Root):**
   - **Delete or Free Nodes of a Tree:** This traversal is suitable for safely deleting or freeing nodes in a tree, as it starts from the leaves and ensures that a node is deleted only after its children are deleted.
   - **Expression Trees:** In expression trees, post-order traversal gives a postfix expression (Reverse Polish notation). This is useful in certain types of expression evaluation algorithms.
   - **Solving Tree Dynamic Programming Problems:** Post-order traversal is often used in dynamic programming on trees, as it allows computation of answers for each subtree first, which can then be used to compute the answer for the parent node.

3. **In-Order Traversal (Left, Root, Right):**
   - **Binary Search Trees (BST):** In a BST, in-order traversal retrieves data in sorted order. This property is crucial for operations like displaying the contents of a BST in a sorted manner.
   - **Tree Balancing Algorithms:** In-order traversal is useful in algorithms that need to convert a BST into a balanced BST. For instance, AVL tree rotations can use in-order data for rebalancing.
   - **Graphical Representation:** For binary trees that represent graphical shapes or structures, in-order traversal can be used to render these shapes in a logical order.

Each of these traversals offers a different way to access and manipulate the elements of a tree, making them crucial tools in the toolkit of computer programmers, particularly when working with tree-based data structures like binary trees, expression trees, and binary search trees.
