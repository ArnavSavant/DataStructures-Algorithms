/*
The provided `countSubmatrices` method aims to count the number of submatrices within a given 2D `grid` where the sum of elements is less than or equal to `k`. However, the current implementation only counts individual cells meeting the condition and does not fully address the problem of counting all possible submatrices. To achieve the intended functionality, a more comprehensive approach is necessary.

### Revised Approach and Explanation

The goal is to count all submatrices, not just individual cells, with sums ≤ `k`. A correct approach involves three main steps:

1. **Compute Prefix Sums**: Calculate prefix sums for each row to facilitate quick sum retrieval for any subarray within a row.

2. **Enumerate All Submatrices**: For each possible top-left corner of a submatrix, iterate through all possible bottom-right corners. Use the prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum of each submatrix.

3. **Count Submatrices with Sum ≤ `k`**: For each submatrix, check if its sum is ≤ `k`. If so, increment the count.

Here's a high-level outline to address the counting of all submatrices:

```java
public int countSubmatricesWithSumK(int[][] grid, int k) {
    int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    // Compute row-wise prefix sums
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            grid[i][j] += grid[i][j - 1];
        }
    }
    int count = 0;
    // Enumerate left and right columns of submatrices
    for (int left = 0; left < n; left++) {
        for (int right = left; right < n; right++) {
            Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
            map.put(0, 1); // Base case for submatrices starting from row 0
            int sum = 0;
            // Enumerate top and bottom rows of submatrices
            for (int top = 0; top < m; top++) {
                // Calculate sum of submatrix [0..top, left..right]
                sum += grid[top][right] - (left > 0 ? grid[top][left - 1] : 0);
                // If (sum - k) exists in map, add its frequency to count
                count += map.getOrDefault(sum - k, 0);
                // Update map with current sum
                map.put(sum, map.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The revised approach has a time complexity of O(m * n^2) for the outer loops over columns and O(m) for the inner loop over rows, leading to O(m^2 * n^2) without optimization and O(m * n^2) with row prefix sums and hashmap optimization.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) for the hashmap used to store intermediate submatrix sums, where m is the number of rows in the grid.

### Summary

To accurately count all submatrices with sums ≤ `k`, it's essential to enumerate all possible submatrices and efficiently compute their sums using prefix sums and hashmap techniques for optimization. The revised approach outlined above provides a framework for correctly solving this problem.
