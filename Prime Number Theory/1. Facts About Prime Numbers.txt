1. '2' is the only even prime number.

2. Every prime can be written as 6b+1 or 6n-1, except 2 and 3, n is a natural number.

3. Every even integer greater than 2 can be expected as the sum of two primes.

4. '2' and '3' are only consecutive numbers that are prime.

To find out whether a nummber is prime or not, we can find a solution with a TC < O(n).
The biggest factor which will divide the number will be sqrt(n). After that, factors will start repeating themselves.
eg:36
    1 * 36
    2 * 18
    3 * 12
    4 * 9
    6 * 6
-------------
    9 * 4
   12 * 3
   18 * 2
   36 * 1
 pseudo code:
 for(int i=1;i<=sqrt(n);i++) {
   if(n%i == 0) {
      count++;
   }
   if((n/i) != i) { //if factor is not repeating.
      count++;
   }
 }
